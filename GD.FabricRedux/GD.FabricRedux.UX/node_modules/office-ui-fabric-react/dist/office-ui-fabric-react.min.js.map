Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\n\t * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\n\t * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\n\t * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\n\t *\n\t * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\n\t * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\n\t *\n\t * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\n\t * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow.

Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if provided by\n * the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\n *\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\n *\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\n *\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\n *\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow.
